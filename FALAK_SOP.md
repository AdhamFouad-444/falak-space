# FALAK Initiative - Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

**Initiative Overview**
FALAK is a student-led initiative exploring how space education and participation can be made more open, accessible, and practical. Currently in the early research and design phase, FALAK focuses on building a scalable pathway into space — from STEM education and rocketry fundamentals to hands-on experimentation and future launch access.

**Mission:** Opening Pathways into Space  
**Status:** Research & Design Phase  
**Core Philosophy:** Progression, not gatekeeping. We believe accessibility drives innovation.  
**Approach:** Leading with inclusivity, enabled by AI, grounded in community.
