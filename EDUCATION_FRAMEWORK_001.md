# FALAk – Education Framework 001
**Title:** From Earth to Space: Systems, Constraints, and Limits  
**Date:** 01.24.2026  
**Purpose:** Teach how space works, how we reach it, how systems operate, and where physics draws hard boundaries.

## SECTION 1 — WHAT IS SPACE

### 1.1 What “Space” Means (Definition)
*   **Concept:** Space is not emptiness.
*   **Boundary:** Space begins where aerodynamic flight ends and orbital mechanics dominate.
*   **Metric:** Practical boundary: ~100 km (Kármán Line).
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand that space is defined by physics, not distance.

### 1.2 Earth’s Atmospheric Layers (Ordered)
*   Troposphere (0–12 km)
*   Stratosphere (12–50 km)
*   Mesosphere (50–85 km)
*   Thermosphere (85–500+ km)
*   Exosphere (≈500–10,000 km)
*   **Learning Outcome:** Know which technologies operate in which layers and why.

### 1.3 Why Space Is “Hostile by Default”
*   No air → no lift, no breathing
*   Extreme temperatures
*   Radiation exposure
*   No repair or rescue
*   Errors are irreversible
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why space engineering is unforgiving.

### 1.4 Motion Beyond Earth
*   Gravity never turns off
*   Free-fall and inertia
*   “Floating” is continuous falling
*   **Learning Outcome:** Correctly explain why objects stay in orbit.

### 1.5 Orbits
*   Circular vs elliptical
*   Altitude vs energy
*   Orbital decay and stability
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand orbit as an energy problem, not height.

## ⬇️ TRANSITION QUESTION
*If space works like this — how do we get there from Earth?*

## SECTION 2 — HOW WE GET THERE (EARTH → ORBIT)

### 2.1 The Launch Problem
*   Earth’s gravity pulls everything down
*   Atmosphere causes drag and heating
*   Wings stop working well below space
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why normal flight cannot reach space.

### 2.2 Why Rockets, Not Planes
*   Rockets carry their own oxidizer
*   Thrust works in vacuum
*   Newton’s Third Law (action–reaction)
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why rockets are required.

### 2.3 The Rocket as a System
*   **Subsystems:** Propulsion, Structure, Fuel & oxidizer, Guidance & control, Avionics, Payload.
*   **Learning Outcome:** See rockets as integrated systems, not engines.

### 2.4 Propulsion (Conceptual)
*   Thrust generation
*   Exhaust velocity
*   Trade-offs between power and mass
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why more thrust creates new constraints.

### 2.5 The Mass Problem
*   Fuel dominates mass
*   Payload is a small fraction
*   Structural limits grow rapidly
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why rockets scale poorly.

### 2.6 Staging
*   Dropping dead weight
*   Efficiency gains
*   Why single-stage rockets struggle
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why staging is unavoidable.

### 2.7 Guidance, Navigation & Control
*   Stability
*   Error growth
*   Feedback systems
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why rockets must constantly correct themselves.

### 2.8 Structural & Thermal Loads
*   Vibration
*   Acceleration
*   Heating during ascent
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why launch is the most failure-prone phase.

### 2.9 Launch Profile
*   Vertical liftoff
*   Gradual pitch-over
*   Sideways acceleration
*   Orbital insertion
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand that orbit is about speed, not altitude.

## SECTION 3 — LAUNCH OPERATIONS & SEQUENCING (Educational, non-procedural)

### 3.1 What a Launch Sequence Is
*   A controlled transition between system states
*   Safe → conditioned → fueled → armed → ignition → liftoff
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand launch as a system state machine.

### 3.2 Ground Systems as Part of the Rocket
*   Propellant systems
*   Purge and pressurization (e.g. nitrogen)
*   Flame trench & water deluge
*   Power, data, and telemetry

*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand that launch is mostly a ground operation.

### 3.3 Conditioning & Purging (Conceptual)
*   Inert gases reduce fire risk
*   Prevent condensation and contamination
*   Leak detection before fueling
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why rockets are “prepared” before fueling.

### 3.4 Fueling & Pressurization (Conceptual)
*   Cryogenic behavior
*   Thermal stress
*   Tank pressure management
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why fueling is slow and risky.

### 3.5 Terminal Count (Conceptual)
*   Go / no-go polls
*   Hold points
*   Automation for time-critical events
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why humans hand control to software.

### 3.6 Ignition to Liftoff (Conceptual)
*   Engine start
*   Thrust verification
*   Commit to flight
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why engines are verified before release.

### 3.7 Abort Philosophy (High-Level)
*   Pre-commit holds
*   Post-commit safety logic
*   Public safety first
*   **Learning Outcome:** Understand why abort rules exist.

### 3.8 Control Room & Communication
